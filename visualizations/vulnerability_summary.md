## Implications

This analysis highlights that the vast majority of popular NPM packages (95.8%) have no disclosed vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities that do exist are concentrated in a relatively small number of packages, with just a few packages accounting for a significant portion of all vulnerabilities.

This suggests that vulnerability reporting may be disproportionately focused on a small subset of packages, potentially leaving many vulnerabilities in other packages undiscovered or unreported.
