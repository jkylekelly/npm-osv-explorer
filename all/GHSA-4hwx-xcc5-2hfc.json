  "summary": "tarteaucitron.js allows prototype pollution via custom text injection",
  "details": "A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, where the `addOrUpdate` function, used for applying custom texts, did not properly validate input. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to manipulate JavaScript object prototypes, leading to potential security risks such as data corruption or unintended code execution.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to:\n- Modify object prototypes, affecting core JavaScript behavior,\n- Cause application crashes or unexpected behavior,\n- Potentially introduce further security vulnerabilities depending on the application's architecture.\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/74c354c413ee3f82dff97a15a0a43942887c2b5b\nThe issue was resolved by ensuring that user-controlled inputs cannot modify JavaScript object prototypes.",
