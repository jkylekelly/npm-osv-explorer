The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (42a2eee90f82caaf89babfc6ae7de546ed7e933760e635c592ca82a6aae745aa)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'shyftportal' @ 1.0.6 (npm) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
