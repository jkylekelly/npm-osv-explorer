  "details": "The package contains several malicious PowerShell and VBS scripts used to harvest browser data, take screenshots, log keystrokes, and establish startup persistence. It also bundles a password stealer and exfiltrates stolen data via Slack and Discord webhooks.\n\n---\n_-= Per source details.

All secrets and keys stored on that computer should be rotated immediately from a different computer. The package should be removed, but as full control of the computer may have been given to an outside entity, there is no guarantee that removing the package will remove all malicious software resulting from installing it.\n",
