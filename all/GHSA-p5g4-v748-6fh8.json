  "summary": "tarteaucitron.js allows url scheme injection via unfiltered inputs",
  "details": "A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, allowing a user with high privileges (access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin) to enter a URL containing an insecure scheme such as `javascript:alert()`. Before the fix, URL validation was insufficient, which could allow arbitrary JavaScript execution if a user clicked on a malicious link.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with high privileges could insert a link exploiting an insecure URL scheme, leading to:\n- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code\n- Theft of sensitive data through phishing attacks\n- Modification of the user interface behavior\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/2fa1e01023bce2e4b813200600bb1619d56ceb02\nThe issue was resolved by enforcing strict URL validation, ensuring that they start with `http://` or `https://` before being used.",
