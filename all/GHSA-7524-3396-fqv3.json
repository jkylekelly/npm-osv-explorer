  "summary": "tarteaucitron.js allows UI manipulation via unrestricted CSS injection",
  "details": "A vulnerability was identified in `tarteaucitron.js`, where user-controlled inputs for element dimensions (`width` and `height`) were not properly validated. This allowed an attacker with direct access to the site's source code or a CMS plugin to set values like `100%;height:100%;position:fixed;`, potentially covering the entire viewport and facilitating clickjacking attacks.\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker with high privileges could exploit this vulnerability to:\n- Overlay malicious UI elements on top of legitimate content,\n- Trick users into interacting with hidden elements (clickjacking),\n- Disrupt the intended functionality and accessibility of the website.\n\n## Fix https://github.com/AmauriC/tarteaucitron.js/commit/25fcf828aaa55306ddc09cfbac9a6f8f126e2d07\nThe issue was resolved by enforcing strict validation and sanitization of user-provided CSS values to prevent unintended UI manipulation.",
