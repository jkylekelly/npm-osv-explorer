  "summary": "ts-asn1-der has Incorrect DER Encoding of Numbers Leading to Denial of Service and Incorrect Value Representation",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nIncorrect `number` DER encoding can lead to denial on service for absolute values in the range `2**31` -- `2**32 - 1`. The arithmetic in the `numBitLen` didn't take into account that values in this range could result in a negative result upon applying the `>>` operator, leading to an infinite loop.\n\nIn addition, `number` encoding had a few other issues that resulted it in it not encoding values correctly.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is patched in version `1.0.4`. Users are recommended to upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not an option, the issue can be mitigated by validating inputs to `Asn1Integer` to ensure that they are not smaller than `-2**31 + 1` and no larger than `2**31 - 1`. Although `Asn1Integer` supports `bigint` inputs, some additional implementation issues make using `bigint` as a mitigation inviable, as it will result in incorrect values.\n\nIf upgrading is not an option and range checks are impractical or undesirable, input to `Asn1Integer` can be provided as a buffer to be used directly. Note that this requires computing the correct DER encoding externally.\n\n### References\n\nN/A",
