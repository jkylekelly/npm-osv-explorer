  "summary": "CKEditor4 low-risk cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability linked to potential domain takeover",
  "details": "### Affected Packages\n\nThe issue impacts only editor instances with enabled [version notifications](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html#cfg-versionCheck).\n\nPlease note that this feature is disabled by default in all CKEditor 4 LTS versions. Therefore, if you use CKEditor 4 LTS, it is highly unlikely that you are affected by this vulnerability. If you are unsure, please [contact us](mailto:security@cksource.com).\n\n### Impact\n\nA theoretical vulnerability has been identified in CKEditor 4.22 (and above). In a highly unlikely scenario where an attacker gains control over the https://cke4.ckeditor.com domain, they could potentially execute an attack on CKEditor 4 instances. Although the vulnerability is purely hypothetical, we have addressed it in CKEditor 4.25.0-lts to ensure compliance with security best practices.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 4.25.0-lts.\n\n### For More Information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please email us at [security@cksource.com](mailto:security@cksource.com).",
